ðŸ“š A browser extension for [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr).

ðŸš§ **There is [work in progress](https://github.com/piraces/tldr-extension-browser/projects/1) for this extension** ðŸš§

**Feel free to contribute ðŸ˜€!!**

## Download

**Note:** The extension is being reviewed by the Chrome Store and Edge developer program and should be published in a near future.

ðŸš§ Get the extension 
[in the Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/tldr-pages). ðŸš§

## Loading Extension for development

- The extension is yet to be released to the chrome webstore.
- Ensure you compile styles and install the needed libraries running the following commands:
```bash
npm i
npm run process-styles
```
- To load the extension, download the repository and open the extension preferences in Chrome/Chromium based browsers (go to `chrome://extensions`). Click the box marked as `Developer mode` and click the button `Load unpacked extension...` after which you can navigate to the project directory and load tldr-pages.


## How it works

-  Highlight and right click a command on your webpage and select `tldr-pages` in the drop down - a tooltip should appear with information fetched from [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr).
